## Topic of the Series
Programming skills that will survive the Pandemic
Episode 1: Polyglot programming - Praseed Pai

COVID 19 is upsetting everything possible. Nothing will be the same again. Industries around the world can be revived only if it embraces the tech-disruption on a scale the world has never seen before.

As Programmers, we also need to cater to the demands of the New Future! The days that follow the lockdown will see a tremendous increase in the varied requirements and customer demands. In such a challenging future, only the fittest will survive for a longer run. Thankfully, for programmers, all we need to do to do is sharpen our already-acquired skills!

You may be working on limited boundaries of one or two programming languages till now. But, adaptable coding is going to be vital for future programmers. Understanding the concepts of adaptive coding would help you to switch to any other language as per need. This is one thing that is going to set you apart from others. You need to become a polyglot in the vast sea of languages.

There is no choice. Upgrade your skills or perish.
FAYA:80 is coming with a FREE Open Online Tech Talk Series "Programming skills that will survive the Pandemic" to help programmers around the world to galvanize against the future requirements.

Join its Episode 1: Polyglot programming on 8th April at 6 PM.
